# TODOs

## Order page
- Split into multiple pages, because current implementation is too hard to navigate, especially with editing requirement.
    - Entry page, where order date, type, customer are selected.
    This is the same page, where order to edit id can be entered.
    Also where previous order data can be downloaded.
    - Item page, where products, quantities and discounts are entered.
    This is also where order can be exported and invoice issued.

- Current manager print out should be 'user' print out - who is logged in
and editing.
- Manager should be added as customer attribute
- Add date filter when downloading order history
